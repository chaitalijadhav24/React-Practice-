                    Matter Preschool Curriculum</h3>
                    <p> Our curriculum focuses on the holistic development of the child and is suitably
                        mapped to age-appropriate objectives and outcomes. Based on Dr. Howard
                        Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Experiential Learning, the
                        KLAY curriculum empowers the child to be able to establish a routine, follow
                        directions, make friends and work independently.</p>
