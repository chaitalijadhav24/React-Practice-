            <p> In order to enable employees to bring their children to work and provide them with world class education, we have an employee-child education policy in
                place. Employees with young children who fit into the age group and schooling programmes offered in the Centre they are working at, can enrol their
                child in to their age specific programmes. The fee for the schooling/day care program will be subsidised</p>
